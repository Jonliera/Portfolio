        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm <em>Jonathan</em> and I am really <strong>happy</strong> that you are here.
          I was born and raised in Mexico City. I have a BA in Marketing. I've always worked in Sales and Marketing for different tech companies.
          Some of the companies I worked for are <span>Lenovo</span>, <span>Motorola</span>, <span>LG</span> to name a few. 
          I remember a few years back when I started looking into coding because it just seemed so interesting.
          Everyone I asked about it told me it was hard and that I should stick to what I knew. 
          It took me a while to ignore everyone's comments and give coding a try.
          Fast forward a few years later, I came across Epicodus, then I knew I had to follow my dream.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/Jonliera/hello-world.git">Hello World</a>
            <ul>
              <li>This project is my first. It's the most basic project, as you will see it's very simple code.</li>
              <li>It's my first written code on HTML.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/Jonliera/my-first-webpage.git">My First Webpage</a>
            <ul>
              <li>This project is the one I like the most because it keeps growing. I go back to it and make changes with what I'm learning in my classes.</li>
              <li>It uses HTML, MARKDOWN and CSS.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/Jonliera/resort.git">Private Resort</a>
            <ul>
              <li>My favorite project so far is Private Resort. I added some pictures for content. I like how it links to different pages.</li>
              <li>I love coding. I think as of today, designing it's the hardest part. I'm sure that I will get better with time.</li>
              <li>It uses HTML, CSS and Git branches.</li>
