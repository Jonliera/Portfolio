    <p>Hi, I'm <em>Jonathan Liera</em> and I am really <strong>happy</strong> that you are here.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Mexico City. I have a BA in Marketing. I've always worked in Sales and Marketing for different tech companies. Some of the companies I worked for are Lenovo, Motorola, LG, to name a few. I remeber a few years back when I started looking into coding because it just seemed so interesting. Everyone I asked about it told me it was hard and that I should stick to what I knew. It took me a while to actually to get over everyone's comments and actually give it a try. Forward a few years later I came across Epicodus. And it was then, that I knew I had to follow my dream. </p>
