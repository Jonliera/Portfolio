  <p class="intro">Hi, I'm <em>Jonathan</em> and I am really <strong>happy</strong> that you are here</p>
  <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
  
  <p class="info">
    I was born and raised in Mexico City. I have a BA in Marketing. I've always worked in Sales and Marketing for different tech companies. Some of the companies I worked for are <span class="companies">Lenovo, Motorola, LG</span> to name a few. I remeber a few years back when I started looking into coding because it just seemed so interesting. Everyone I asked about it told me it was hard and that I should stick to what I knew. It took me a while to actually to get over everyone's comments and give it a try. Fast forward a few years later, I came across Epicodus. It was then, that I knew I had to follow my dream.
